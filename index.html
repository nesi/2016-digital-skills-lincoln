<p itemprop="description">This event provides an opportunity for all researchers to improve their computational lab skills through a number of hands-on training sessions. Training modules are offered by experienced researchers who are keen to share their knowledge and skills with members of their research communities.</p>

<p> Digital Skills for Research Training Week @ Lincoln is organised by several New Zealand research institutions:
<a href="http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/">Landcare Research</a>,
<a href="http://www.agresearch.co.nz/">AgResearch</a>,
<a href="http://www.plantandfood.co.nz/">Plant & Food Research</a>,
<a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/">Lincoln University</a>,
<a href="http://www.nzgenomics.co.nz/">New Zealand Genomics Ltd (NZGL)</a>
 and <a href="http://www.nesi.org.nz/">New Zealand e-Science Infrastructure</a>. </p>

<p> This event consists of two parts. The first one is the Software Carpentry workshop which will take place 17-18th October, 2016. This hands-on workshop takes full two days (see the details below). The second part of this training event is an array of shorter training modules which are more domain-specific (please see the schedule below). </p>

<p> You are welcome to sign up for any sessions you find useful. You can choose to attend only Software Carpentry workshop or only some of the sessions taking place between 19th and 21st October. However, please note that if you want to attend Software Carpentry workshop, we advise that you come for the full two days (Monday and Tuesday). </p>

<p>We are currently looking into options of offering a few more sessions. They will be added as soon as we confirm them. So watch this space!</p>

      <p class="speakers-bio">This seminar discusses some aspects of research planning that can be more effective through the use of statistical ideas. These include: setting your study objective; choosing your experimental ‘treatments’ and material; ideas that affect the structure of an experiment such as of ‘blocking’ and replication; trial ‘layout’; sampling, and data management. Most of these ideas apply whether the study/experiment uses people, plants, insects or any other biological material, and apply wherever the experiment might be based (many fields, fields, laboratory, tasting room, analytical instrument, etc.).</p>

            <td class="schedule-description">This seminar discusses some aspects of research planning that can be more effective through the use of statistical ideas. These include: setting your study objective; choosing your experimental ‘treatments’ and material; ideas that affect the structure of an experiment such as of ‘blocking’ and replication; trial ‘layout’; sampling, and data management. Most of these ideas apply whether the study/experiment uses people, plants, insects or any other biological material, and apply wherever the experiment might be based (many fields, fields, laboratory, tasting room, analytical instrument, etc.).</td>
